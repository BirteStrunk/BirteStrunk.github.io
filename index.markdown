### Hey there!
<br />

I am Birte, an economist and philosopher based in Brooklyn. I hold a PhD in economics from the [New School for Social Research](https://www.newschool.edu/nssr/){:target="_blank"} in New York City, and I am currently pursuing a second PhD in philosophy at NSSR. As part of my economics PhD, I have been a research fellow at the [ZOE Institute for future-fit economies](https://zoe-institut.de/en/person/birte-strunk-2/){:target="_blank”}, and I spent fall 2022 as a visiting research fellow at [Harvard University](https://gsas.harvard.edu){:target="_blank”}. 

As an ecological economist, my [research](02_research.markdown) focuses on linking social and ecological perspectives, especially around questions on labor. As a philosopher, I am particularly interested in using the lens of Critical Theory to analyse the climate crisis. In the past, I have [published](/03_publications.markdown) on feminist ecological economics, degrowth and philosophy of (plural) economics. In my free time, I play [foosball](https://dtfb.de/wettbewerbe/dtfl-bundesliga/damen4/bundesliga-damen/tabelle?task=team_details&id=4520){:target="_blank"} competitively, and I like to sing, roller skate, and run.
