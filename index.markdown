### Hey there!
<br />
I am Birte, a PhD candidate in economics at the [New School for Social Research](https://www.newschool.edu/nssr/){:target="_blank"} in New York City, and a research fellow at the [ZOE Institute for future-fit economies](https://zoe-institut.de/en/person/birte-strunk-2/){:target="_blank"}. As part of my PhD, I spent fall 2022 as a visiting research fellow at [Harvard University](https://gsas.harvard.edu){:target="_blank"}. Next to my PhD, I also pursued a Masters in Philosophy at [Fernuniversit√§t Hagen](https://www.fernuni-hagen.de/KSW/portale/maphil/){:target="_blank"}, which I finished in October 2023.

As an ecological economist, my current [research](02_research.markdown) focuses on linking social and ecological perspectives, especially around questions on labor. In the past, I have [published](/03_publications.markdown) on feminist ecological economics, degrowth and philosophy of (plural) economics. In my free time, I play [foosball]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Et2e1_NCzwA](https://dtfb.de/wettbewerbe/dtfl-bundesliga/damen4/bundesliga-damen/tabelle?task=team_details&id=4520)){:target="_blank"} competitively, and I like to sing, roller skate, and run.
