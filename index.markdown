### Hey!

I am Birte, a PhD student in economics at the [New School for Social Research](https://www.newschool.edu/nssr/){:target="_blank"} in New York City, and a research fellow at the [ZOE Institute for future-fit economies](https://zoe-institut.de/en/startpage/){:target="_blank"}. Next to my PhD, I'm also doing a Masters in Philosophy at [Fernuniversit√§t Hagen](https://www.fernuni-hagen.de/KSW/portale/maphil/){:target="_blank"}.

As an ecological economist, my current [research](02_research.markdown) focuses on linking social and ecological perspectives, especially around questions on labor. In the past, I have [published](/03_publications.markdown) on feminist ecological economics, degrowth and philosophy of (plural) economics. In my free time, I play [foosball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Et2e1_NCzwA){:target="_blank"} semi-professionally, and I like to sing, roller skate, and run.
