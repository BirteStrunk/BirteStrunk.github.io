## Research

<br />
My research interests are quite varied (hence the degrees in economics *and* philosophy), including areas such as Ecological (Macro)Economics, Comparative Political Economy and Varieties of Capitalism, Post-growth/degrowth, Labor Economics, Feminist Theory, or Philosophy of Economics. I'm driven by questions rather than by disciplinary boundaries, and most of these questions circle around the conditions, requirements and challenges of a socio-ecological transition in the face of climate breakdown.

Rather than trying to boil down my research to specific areas, I'd like to present some current research that is in various stages - I hope that this list will give a better idea of what I am currently working on and thinking through. If you are interested in any of these topics, I'm always happy to exchange thoughts!

    <summary>The role of labor in a socio-ecological transition: Combining post-Keynesian and ecological economics perspectives (with Stefan Ederer and Armon Rezai)</summary>
    <br />
    This paper, which I am working on with Stefan Ederer and Armon Rezai, builds upon some of the research from my Master thesis on Ecological Macroeconomics. We make a case for post-Keynesian economists to think more explicitly about labor markets so that ecological economics, which grants labor a crucial role in socio-ecological transformations, can draw more straightforwardly from post-Keynesian modeling. We present a systematic review of building blocks of post-Keynesian thinking about labor markets that would be relevant for such an integration, and make the case for ecological macroeconomics to model specific policies, rather than general dynamics. We are also working on a follow-up paper which would translate these conceptual thoughts into a Kalecki-Steindl model that models climate dynamics, growth, and the labor market.

    <summary>Women (and men) in ‘lousy jobs’ – A cross-country analysis on wage structures, institutions and gender inequality (with David Howell)</summary>
    <br />
    This is a research project I am working on with David Howell, my doctoral advisor. This is the current abstract: Mainstream economic research on the gender wage gap has focused mainly on employment sorting – the allocation of women into different segments of the labor market – and wage discrimination.  While heterodox institutional and radical feminist economics perspectives tend to agree that these are both important sources of the gender wage gaps, they put much greater weight on the kind of job structure people are sorting into, as well as more broadly, on wage dependence itself, i.e. how much of provisioning in a given system is allocated on the market and thus dependent on income. Rather than investigating wage gaps, this paper looks at pay quality incidence indicators that measure the share of workers in ‘lousy jobs’ – those that pay very low wages or in which workers are employed involuntarily part-time. In a varieties of capitalism framework, we study five countries (US, UK, Australia, Canada, France) between 1979 and 2016, and focus on young (18-34) workers with less than a college degree. Not surprisingly, the lousy job incidence is higher for women than for men in all five countries, yet size and trends in the pay gap varies substantially, with the most extreme differences occurring in the US and France. To explain these cross-country gender gap patterns, we compare the sorting of women by industry and occupation as well as differences in the quality of the pay structures into which women and men are employed, paying close attention to the institutional context of liberal versus coordinated market economies.

    <summary>Carbon emissions, inequality and labor supply: A US state-level analysis of the role of Veblen effects in carbon inequality (with Till van Treeck)</summary>
    <br />
    This is a project in an early stage. Picking up on work by Jorgenson et al (2017) on income inequality and carbon emissions, we want to investigate potential Veblen effects mediating the relationship between carbon emissions and income inequality via people's labor supply decisions. The hypothesis we want to test is that higher inequality leads to people working longer hours and that those longer hours are connected to increased carbon emissions. Since we are at an early stage, we do not yet have any preliminary results.

    <summary>What about the Global South?, revisited: Degrowth, interdependencies and ecological unequal exchange (with Claudius Gräbner)</summary>
    <br />
    This is a project in an early stage. Together with Claudius Gräbner, we're picking up on the important work that has emerged in the degrowth discourse (see e.g. Dengler/Seebacher 2019) that critically evaluates degrowth in a global context. While degrowth is primarily a concept and call to action by and for the Global North, it has often been pointed out that it has its roots in post-development thinking from the South. Nonetheless, in a globally entangled world, degrowth in the North has important consequences for the South, and rather than thinking in a North-South binary, we are interested in the global structures of interdependencies. In this paper, we start by creating a literature overview of current degrowth thinking on matters relating to global interdependencies and then want to move forward analyzing  global institutional structures that lock in growth dynamics in both the Global North and South.

    <summary>Post-growth dialectics: A post-growth transition as a threat or a promise?</summary>
    <br />
    This is a paper I wrote for a philosophy class in Environmental Ethics, and I am working on bringing it to a stage ready for submission. In it, I make the argument that the discourse around a post-growth transition entails a core dialectic: The narrative around the shift can be framed in terms of threat or promise. Both stories are inherently contradictory, while both being true. Although it is conventional wisdom that any transition implies both challenges and opportunities, the task of this paper is specifically to work out how the degrowth discourse can systematically be structured around being threat- or promise-focused, and that the differences in focus imply different ethics: while the threat narrative implies what I call an ‘ethics of constraint’, the promise narrative is based on an ‘ethics of abundance’. Being clear about the two different tales of degrowth transitions, I argue in the paper, is relevant to navigate the challenge ahead without getting (too) lost in misunderstandings and cross-talking.

    <summary>The Sin of Omission in the Economics of Climate Change</summary>
    <br />
    This is a paper I wrote for a class in Economic Sociology, and I am working on making it ready for submission. In it, I argue that the discipline of economics is committing a sin of omission in its thinking about climate change. Picking up on the notion of ‘sin of omission’ by Akerlof (2020), I criticize the discipline’s narrow and one-dimensional focus, which is especially problematic when it comes to tackling climate change. In fact, the mainstream response to the climate emergency is deeply embedded in concepts such as utility-maximising and scarcity thinking, which leads to a framing of the climate emergency as a 'market failure', and the proposed solution of 'pricing externalities'. As I show in this paper, however, these very concepts are part and parcel of the history of climate change and its entanglement with the rise of capitalism. Addressing the climate emergency, thus, urgently needs tools that think about economic matters outside of the narrow confines of the economic mainstream. In this article, I show how heterodox contributions, especially from ecological, feminist and marxist approaches, offer both relevant critiques as well as relevant ways forward for tackling the climate crisis in ways beyond mere 'pricing externalities'. Not considering these perspectives in the discipline of economics, I argue, would constitute a heavy 'sin of omission'.
