## Research

<br />
My research interests are quite varied (hence the degrees in economics *and* philosophy), including areas such as Ecological (Macro)Economics, Comparative Political Economy and Varieties of Capitalism, Post-growth/degrowth, Labor Economics, Feminist Theory, or Philosophy of Economics. I'm driven by questions rather than by disciplinary boundaries, and most of these questions circle around the conditions, requirements and challenges of a socio-ecological transition in the face of climate breakdown.

Rather than trying to boil down my research to specific areas, I'd like to present some current research that is in various stages - I hope that this list will give a better idea of what I am currently working on and thinking through. If you are interested in any of these topics, I'm always happy to exchange thoughts!

    <summary>What’s wrong with the ‘grand gender convergence’? Gender wage gaps, care penalties and essential work in the United States</summary>
    <br />
    Although (White) women have increasingly shifted out of low-paid work over the past four decades in the US, female-coded work is still badly paid, despite often being essential. In this article, I use regression and descriptive methodologies to confirm prior literature on pay penalties for nurturant and reproductive care workers. Beyond the relative pay penalty, I show that care jobs are often bad in absolute terms, since a third of all care workers receive lousy wages, as do a quarter of essential care workers. Especially reproductive care jobs are compensated badly, with half of all essential workers in reproductive care receiving lousy wages. I trace changes in the demographic composition of the low-wage workforce, to show that is has become less White and less female over the past four decades. While this has partly driven greater gender equality, I argue greater gender justice only occurs once female-coded care work is recognized (and compensated) for its essential contribution to overall economic activity. A strategy of shifting this type of work to the bottom of the racial and gender division of labor not only fails to promote greater gender justice, but also deepens existing racial injustices.

    <summary>Carbon emissions, inequality and working hours: A US state-level analysis of the role of Veblen effects in labor supply and emissions</summary>
    <br />
    This article contributes to the literature on the link between inequality and emissions in a theoretical framework of social comparison-based utility related to labor supply. Specifically, I investigate potential Veblen effects mediating the relationship between top-end income inequality and carbon emissions via people’s labor supply decisions using US state level data from 1979-2018. I test two different hypotheses: firstly, that higher inequality leads to people working longer hours and secondly, that those longer hours are connected to increased carbon emissions. The results show positive and significant effects for both hypotheses, albeit effect sizes are rather small. While this paper does not argue that labor supply is the main channel through which top-end inequality impacts carbon emissions, it does conclude that labor supply is an important piece of the puzzle to understand this association.

    <summary>The Sin of Omission in the Economics of Climate Change</summary>
    <br />
    In this paper, I argue that the discipline of economics is committing a sin of omission in its thinking about climate change. Picking up on the notion of ‘sin of omission’ by Akerlof (2020), I criticize the discipline’s narrow and one-dimensional focus, which is especially problematic when it comes to tackling climate change. In fact, the mainstream response to the climate emergency is deeply embedded in concepts such as utility-maximising and scarcity thinking, which leads to a framing of the climate emergency as a 'market failure', and the proposed solution of 'pricing externalities'. As I show in this paper, however, these very concepts are part and parcel of the history of climate change and its entanglement with the rise of capitalism. Addressing the climate emergency, thus, urgently needs tools that think about economic matters outside of the narrow confines of the economic mainstream. In this article, I show how heterodox contributions, especially from ecological and feminist approaches, offer both relevant critiques as well as relevant ways forward for tackling the climate crisis in ways beyond mere 'pricing externalities'. Not considering these perspectives in the discipline of economics, I argue, would constitute a 'sin of omission'.

    <summary>Closing the Economic Gap: A Pluralist Proposal for Critical Theory</summary>
    <br />
    This article is a response to Cicerchia’s (2024) article 'Making sense of critical theory’s economic gap'. In her article, Cicerchia argues that part of the problem why current Critical Theory does not have a lot to say about the economy is that it inherited a notion of ‘the economic’ from Max Weber which focuses a lot on instrumental rationality. Since this displaced the 'economy proper' from view, she suggests to turn away from Weber toward Marx. Even though I sympathize with the attempt to broaden the conception of ‘the economic’, I argue that such a move would only fill on alleged gap while opening another. Instead, I therefore argue for a pluralistic account of 'the economy' which includes a conception of it as a site of economic provisioning as well as as a site for economic decision-making. I argue that, while Cicerchia's proposal lends itself to a critical analysis of the former, the focus on instrumental rationality is particularly well-suited to critically analyze the latter. I sketch some directions such an analysis might take, thereby showing that Critical Theory already has the tools at hand to start filling its 'economic gap'.

    <summary>Playfulness in writing: Feminist writing as Socratic practice</summary>
    <br />
    Plato promoted playful writing in philosophy. In today’s academy, the most playful form of writing in fields adjacent to philosophy can arguably found in feminist theory. In this paper, I substantiate these two claims and subsequently explore to what extent contemporary feminist writing thus shows explicit traces of a Socratic conception of philosophy. Overall, I argue that it is especially the focus on (the related concepts of) contextuality and ambiguity that may serve as a fruitful lens to interpret feminist philosophy as Socratic in nature. I illustrate that this may account for the fact that both types of writing—Platonic and feminist—make ample use of ‘movement’ in their metaphors as well as overall writing style, and I ultimately argue that the playful way of writing can be interpreted as creating a consistency between content (their respective epistemologies) and form (their presentation).
