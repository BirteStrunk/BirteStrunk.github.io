## Research

<br />
My research interests are quite varied (hence the degrees in economics *and* philosophy), including areas such as Ecological (Macro)Economics, Comparative Political Economy and Varieties of Capitalism, Post-growth/degrowth, Labor Economics, Feminist Theory, or Philosophy of Economics. I'm driven by questions rather than by disciplinary boundaries, and most of these questions circle around the conditions, requirements and challenges of a socio-ecological transition in the face of climate breakdown.

Rather than trying to boil down my research to specific areas, I'd like to present some current research that is in various stages - I hope that this list will give a better idea of what I am currently working on and thinking through. If you are interested in any of these topics, I'm always happy to exchange thoughts!

    <summary>Women (and men) in ‘lousy jobs’ – Wage structures, institutions and gender inequality in the US, 1979-2019 (with David Howell)</summary>
    <br />
    This is a research project I am working on with David Howell, my doctoral advisor. This is the current abstract: Mainstream economic research on the gender wage gap has focused mainly on employment sorting – the allocation of women into different segments of the labor market – and wage discrimination.  While heterodox institutional and radical feminist economics perspectives tend to agree that these are both important sources of the gender wage gaps, they put much greater weight on the kind of job structure people are sorting into, as well as more broadly, on wage dependence itself, i.e. how much of provisioning in a given system is allocated on the market and thus dependent on income. Rather than investigating wage gaps, this paper looks at pay quality incidence indicators that measure the share of workers in ‘lousy jobs’ – those that pay very low wages or in which workers are employed involuntarily part-time. We provide empirical evidence of lousy job incidences for various demographic groups for the US between 1979 and 2019 using CPS ORG data. Not surprisingly, we find that the share of lousy jobs is consistently higher for women than for men. However, while for women this rate has decreased during the sample period, it has increased for males, i.e. while the level of lousy pay is still significantly higher among women than among men, the gap between them has shrunken. We moreover analyze various demographic groups, showing that these dynamics are particularly pronounced among young workers without a college degree.

    <summary>Carbon emissions, inequality and labor supply: A US state-level analysis of the role of Veblen effects in carbon inequality (with Till van Treeck)</summary>
    <br />
    This is a project in an early stage. Picking up on work by Jorgenson et al (2017) on income inequality and carbon emissions, we want to investigate potential Veblen effects mediating the relationship between carbon emissions and income inequality via people's labor supply decisions. The hypothesis we want to test is that higher inequality leads to people working longer hours and that those longer hours are connected to increased carbon emissions. Preliminary results show an effect of inequality on working hours, albeit effect sizes are rather small.

    <summary>Degrowth and the Global South: The twin problem of global dependencies (with Claudius Gräbner)</summary>
    <br />
    In this paper, Claudius Gräbner and I conduct a qualitative as well as quantitative content analysis on the degrowth literature relating to the Global South. While degrowth is primarily a concept and call to action by and for the Global North, it has often been pointed out that it has its roots in post-development thinking from the South, and that degrowth in the North be part and parcel of remedying ecological debt. Nonetheless, in a globally entangled world, degrowth in the North might also have adverse effects on the South. We find that even though structural dependencies are used as a core motivation and justification for degrowth in the North, less attention is paid to potentially adverse short-term effects of degrowth in the North on the South. The existence of these should not be used to negate the necessity of degrowth in the North but implies the need for constructive engagement of the degrowth discourse with these matters. We propose a range of topics and tools that the degrowth literature might want to take into account more in the future as to move forward in analyzing the flipside of global dependencies, i.e. those global institutional structures that lock in growth dynamics in both the Global North and South.

    <summary>Post-growth dialectics: A post-growth transition as a threat or a promise?</summary>
    <br />
    This is a paper that I submitted to journal and which is currently under review. In it, I make the argument that the discourse around a post-growth transition entails a core dialectic: The narrative around the shift can be framed in terms of threat or promise. Both stories are inherently contradictory, while both being true. Although it is conventional wisdom that any transition implies both challenges and opportunities, the task of this paper is specifically to work out how the degrowth discourse can systematically be structured around being threat- or promise-focused, and that the differences in focus imply different ethics: while the threat narrative implies what I call an ‘ethics of constraint’, the promise narrative is based on an ‘ethics of abundance’. Being clear about the two different tales of degrowth transitions, I argue in the paper, is relevant to navigate the challenge ahead without getting (too) lost in misunderstandings and cross-talking.

    <summary>The Sin of Omission in the Economics of Climate Change</summary>
    <br />
    This is a paper I wrote for a class in Economic Sociology, and I am working on making it ready for submission. In it, I argue that the discipline of economics is committing a sin of omission in its thinking about climate change. Picking up on the notion of ‘sin of omission’ by Akerlof (2020), I criticize the discipline’s narrow and one-dimensional focus, which is especially problematic when it comes to tackling climate change. In fact, the mainstream response to the climate emergency is deeply embedded in concepts such as utility-maximising and scarcity thinking, which leads to a framing of the climate emergency as a 'market failure', and the proposed solution of 'pricing externalities'. As I show in this paper, however, these very concepts are part and parcel of the history of climate change and its entanglement with the rise of capitalism. Addressing the climate emergency, thus, urgently needs tools that think about economic matters outside of the narrow confines of the economic mainstream. In this article, I show how heterodox contributions, especially from ecological and feminist approaches, offer both relevant critiques as well as relevant ways forward for tackling the climate crisis in ways beyond mere 'pricing externalities'. Not considering these perspectives in the discipline of economics, I argue, would constitute a 'sin of omission'.
