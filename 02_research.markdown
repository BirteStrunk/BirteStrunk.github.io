## Research

<br />
My research interests are quite varied (hence the degrees in economics *and* philosophy), including areas such as Ecological (Macro)Economics, Comparative Political Economy and Varieties of Capitalism, Post-growth/degrowth, Labor Economics, Feminist Theory, or Philosophy of Economics. I'm driven by questions rather than by disciplinary boundaries, and most of these questions circle around the conditions, requirements and challenges of a socio-ecological transition in the face of climate breakdown.

Rather than trying to boil down my research to specific areas, I'd like to present some current research that is in various stages - I hope that this list will give a better idea of what I am currently working on and thinking through. If you are interested in any of these topics, I'm always happy to exchange thoughts!

    <summary>Women (and men) in ‘lousy jobs’ – A comparative case study on gender inequality, wage structures and institutions in the US and Germany (with David Howell)</summary>
    <br />
    This is a research project supervised by David Howell, my doctoral advisor. This is the current abstract: Mainstream economic research on the gender wage gap has focused mainly on employment sorting – the allocation of women into different segments of the labor market – and wage discrimination. While these factors are both important sources of the gender wage gaps, they do not consider the kind of job structure people are sorting into. Rather than investigating wage gaps, this paper looks at pay quality incidence indicators that measure the share of workers in ‘lousy jobs’ – those that pay very low wages or in which workers are employed involuntarily part-time. We present a comparative case study of wage structures, institutions and gender inequality in the US and Germany between 1995 and 2019, and focus especially on young (18-34) workers with less than a college degree. Not surprisingly, the lousy job share is higher for women than for men in both countries, yet size of the gap and overall trends vary substantially, with the US consistently performing worse than Germany on the incidence measures. We propose a way to make sense of these cross-country patterns by drawing from institutional perspectives, most notably the varieties of capitalism and the growth models frameworks.

    <summary>Carbon emissions, inequality and working hours: A US state-level analysis of the role of Veblen effects in labor supply and emissions (with Till van Treeck)</summary>
    <br />
    This is a research project supervised by Till van Treeck, one of my doctoral advisors. This is the current abstract: In this paper, we contribute to the literature on the link between inequality and emissions in a theoretical framework of social comparison-based utility related to labor supply. Specifically, we investigate potential Veblen effects mediating the relationship between top-end income inequality and carbon emissions via people's labor supply decisions using US state level data from 1979-2018. We test two different hypotheses: firstly, that higher inequality leads to people working longer hours and secondly, that those longer hours are connected to increased carbon emissions. Our results show positive and significant effects for both hypotheses, albeit effect sizes are rather small. While we do not conclude that labor supply is the main channel through which top-end inequality impacts carbon emissions, we argue that labor supply is a piece of the puzzle to understand this association.

    <summary>Post-growth dialectics: A post-growth transition as a threat or a promise?</summary>
    <br />
    This is a paper that I submitted to journal and which is currently under review. In it, I make the argument that the discourse around a post-growth transition entails a core dialectic: The narrative around the shift can be framed in terms of threat or promise. Both stories are inherently contradictory, while both being true. Although it is conventional wisdom that any transition implies both challenges and opportunities, the task of this paper is specifically to work out how the degrowth discourse can systematically be structured around being threat- or promise-focused, and that the differences in focus imply different ethics: while the threat narrative implies what I call an ‘ethics of constraint’, the promise narrative is based on an ‘ethics of abundance’. Being clear about the two different tales of degrowth transitions, I argue in the paper, is relevant to navigate the challenge ahead without getting (too) lost in misunderstandings and cross-talking.

    <summary>The Sin of Omission in the Economics of Climate Change</summary>
    <br />
    This is a paper I wrote for a class in Economic Sociology, and I am working on making it ready for submission. In it, I argue that the discipline of economics is committing a sin of omission in its thinking about climate change. Picking up on the notion of ‘sin of omission’ by Akerlof (2020), I criticize the discipline’s narrow and one-dimensional focus, which is especially problematic when it comes to tackling climate change. In fact, the mainstream response to the climate emergency is deeply embedded in concepts such as utility-maximising and scarcity thinking, which leads to a framing of the climate emergency as a 'market failure', and the proposed solution of 'pricing externalities'. As I show in this paper, however, these very concepts are part and parcel of the history of climate change and its entanglement with the rise of capitalism. Addressing the climate emergency, thus, urgently needs tools that think about economic matters outside of the narrow confines of the economic mainstream. In this article, I show how heterodox contributions, especially from ecological and feminist approaches, offer both relevant critiques as well as relevant ways forward for tackling the climate crisis in ways beyond mere 'pricing externalities'. Not considering these perspectives in the discipline of economics, I argue, would constitute a 'sin of omission'.
