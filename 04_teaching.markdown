## Teaching

### The New School for Social Research  
*Teaching Assistant* for Till van Treeck for the course 'Political Economy of Distribution and Growth: United States and Germany' (2021). 

### University College Maastricht   
After finishing my BA degree, I worked full-time as a *Junior Teaching Fellow* for two semesters (2017-2018). The work included teaching entire courses (along pre-existing syllabi), which included holding all course sessions, grading, and office hours. Moreover, I conducted admission interviews, second-graded BA theses, and contributed to the remodeling of the Research Methods courses and the introduction of the UCM Methods Lab. The teaching method I used was [problem-based learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem-based_learning){:target="_blank"} (PBL). Courses I taught over the year were:  
- Philosophy of Science  
- Contemporary World History  
- Theory Construction and Modeling  
- Research Methods I & II  
- Research Project  


### Exploring Economics Summer Academy   
At the [Summer Academy](https://www.exploring-economics.org/en/participate/summer-academy/){:target="_blank"}, organized by the Network for Pluralist Economics and the Protestant Academy of Thuringia, I've taught the week-long, semester equivalent course *Ecological Economics and Degrowth*, twice together with Corinna Dengler (2018, 2021), once on my own (2019).
