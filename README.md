# BirteStrunk.github.io


This is the repository for my academic website: https://birtestrunk.github.io.

The initial website theme is based on [Academic](https://github.com/gaalcaras/academic) by Gabriel Alcaras. I implemented a range of adjustments based on the adjustments by [Lukas Lehner](https://github.com/lukaslehner/lukaslehner.github.io).

I also followed Lukas' advice to write my academic CV in Markdown. The template and code is based [Steven Miller](http://svmiller.com/blog/2016/03/svm-r-markdown-cv/).
